# Keeper (Keeping notes)

A simple notebook where a user can note down his/her day to day activities.  
The information will be stored in the local storage of the browser and will 
remain there unless deleted.

The following operations which can be performed:-   
1- Add a note with a title which will be displayed on the screen.  
2- Delete a note.   
3- Search for a note based on the content.  

**Tech stack:**  
1- HTML   
2- CSS  
3- JavaScript

I have also included a toggle button for light mode and dark mode.



## Demo 
1- **Adding a note**   
A user can easily add a note just by adding a title and a content and then clicking   
on the **add note** button.

2- **Deleting a note**   
A user can simply delete a note just by clicking on the **delete** button present at  
every note card.

3- **Searching for a note**   
Searching for a note becomes simple just by typing a few words of the content from the note.
